Thank you for interest in translate Obsidian. Please add any controversial terms to this file to aid future decisions during Documentation or UI translation,  creating a consistent experience.

Currently, Obsidian is in development and as new features are added so is more text, if you find a term that is not translated yet, feel free to name it. In the translation file (pt-BR.json), we have different text strings for singular and plural nouns, but it doesn't have a distinction for gender nouns. If you have to translate a word, keep that in mind since it can create some inconsistencies.

In doubt, feel free to ask our amazing community their opinion on the [Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/veuWUTm) (We have a special Portuguese channel!). 

Please keep the term list **alphabetically sorted**.
