Thank you for interest in translate Obsidian. Please add any controversial terms to this file to aid future decisions during Documentation or UI translation,  creating a consistent experience.

Currently, Obsidian is in development and as new features are added so is more text, if you find a term that is not translated yet, feel free to name it. If you have to translate a word, keep that in mind since it can create some inconsistencies.

In doubt, feel free to ask our amazing community their opinion on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/csPS9ba2ZY) (As of now, we have no dedicated `#malay` channel yet, but do give a shoutout to `@Thaza_Kun#9533` or `@StreamFroster#8541` in the `#translations` channel if you're interested). 

Please keep the term list **alphabetically sorted**.
