Thank you for interest in translate Obsidian. Please add any controversial terms to this file to aid future decisions during Documentation or UI translation,  creating a consistent experience.

Currently, Obsidian is in development and as new features are added so is more text, if you find a term that is not translated yet, feel free to name it. If you have to translate a word, keep that in mind since it can create some inconsistencies.

In doubt, feel free to ask our amazing community their opinion on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/veuWUTm) (As of now, we have no dedicated #malay channel yet, but do give a shoutout to @Thaza_Kun#9533 or @StreamFroster#8541 in the #translation channel if you're interested). 

Please keep the term list **alphabetically sorted**.
